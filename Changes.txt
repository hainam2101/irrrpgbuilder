
Changes since AlphaRelease 2 (Release 0.21)
March 2012
- NEW: Reworked the interface so it mimic the wxWidget prototype we had
- NEW: edit camera, based on the IRRlicht Maya Camera. Editing is much improved.
- NEW: Dynamic object highlighting improve precision when moving and placing objects on the map.
- NEW: All Characters now go to "pause" when the player look it's inventory/status window.
- NEW: Animation transitions! Animations look much better.
- NEW: File selector GUI with windows stretching, drive widget and favorite folders

- Update: Updated the script editor with the version from the IRRext repository
- Update: Restructuration of the project folders so it's easier to edit
- Update: The game camera is now following the player and not directly attached to it. Better feeling of movement now.
- Update: Linux project can build the editor and the player (Release and Debug version)

- Fix: Animation events are properly detected (were missing a lot of event before the fix). Animation is much improved now.
- Fix: Water and terrain shaders have been checked to compile on recent ATI, NVIDIA & INTEL hardware (Intel has clipping issue due to a problematic driver)
- Fix: Animation jitter from player when going from walk to run animation
- Fix: Uppercase/Lowercase typos in filenames for the Linux build
- Fix: Check the for death animation, then if the "despawn" animation is not present, dispose of the character properly.
- Fix: Healthbar was displayed for a split second when the character was put on the map.

- Removed: Removed some old meshes and textures that were no longer needed (have already been replaced with better assets)

Changes since AlphaRelease 1 (Release 0.2)
November 2011

- Doing the wxWidget ribbon component with Irrlicht GUI
- Added rain & snow postFX
- Occtree collision on static objects 
- Added more languages
- Improved the wxWidget prototype
- Categories added to the dynamic object selections
- Fixes on the script editor
- Player and Editor builds, player now use "gameconfig.xml" that can start a map at startup
- Improvement in combat calculation and damage
- Put all animations of the character in a single file since, the "swap" animation command was improperly used.
- Improved the game loops (mostly for some ingame requesters)

January/February 2011

- Script EDITOR has now line count ability
- The application now use TABS GUI to categorize tools
- Added "Health" bar for NPC's as a new node
- Added a new graphic GUI Health bar using textures
- Improved the accented character handling via XML (Using TINY XML), characters with accented characters are now converted.

May/2011
- Changed tree system
- Some fixes in TerrainTile to support new tree system.

November/December 2010
- Updated to IRRlicht 1.7.2 with no patch. You can use the official release now.

- Fixed the closing of IRRKlang device that caused a crash/memory leak when closing the application 

- Application use a config.xml file (display, terrain and other things can be set from there)

- Now IRB use a defined scale. 1 unit in the game represent 1 inches. (As in many game engines, ex: Source SDK (Half Life, Left4Dead, Portal, Team Fortress, etc))

- Support external animation files for the player and the dynamic objects. A meshes using the same skeleton structure can share animation using this method. 

- Collisions Using a single collision response animator on player & dynamic objects with a meta selector

- Collisions, the meta selector is updated when a NPC (Dynamic object) is killed. Collision trianges are removed from the meta selector.

- Collisions, the dynamic objects have their own collision response animator

- (Player, Dynamic objects) Properties have been added to the player and the dynamic object to be used later with combat formulas.

- (Player, dynamic objects) External animations can be defined in their XML file

- (player, dynamic objects) preloading of scripts, from the XML

- Player, can define the walking speed from the XML file

- Player, collision detection for obstacles trigger idle animation state

- Player, when life propertie are decreased the hurt animation state is triggered

- Player, when the life propertie is depleted, the death animation state is triggered

- Player, dynamically attack the NPC when the user click on the enemy and is in range. Remove HP on enemy based on simple rules. 

- Combat formulas: Prototype in the player class that use Levels, Experience, HP, and other properties to calculate the damage done to the opponent.

- Cameras: Defined 2 cameras (gameplay and editing). Each camera has their range and FOV.

- Cameras: Mouse in/out in edit mode and run mode. Panning with the mouse is there but still buggy.

- Cameras: Zoom in/out disabled when editing scripts or over a window tool.

- LUA: Dynamic object (NPC) that use the LUA "ChaseObject" will trigger the animation "idle" when it reach a far or near position (parameters)

- LUA: Template script Enemy

- LUA: Template script Follower

- Animation states have been implemented for the AI. A specific animation will be called depending of the event that occur (Going to idle when colliding with an obstacle, so it will not "Moonwalk".)

- Npc have their own Collision Response Animator. So they should not overlap over each other. Still need tweak to define the radius of the collision sphere.

- Performance: Added timers inside the application, so the application should run about the same and is not tied to hardware.

- Performance: Timed the LUA callback to 1/4 second, Animation states 1/60 second refresh

- Performance: Added a yield() to be used in editing mode to give more CPU for other tasks 

- Performance: Implemented VBO hinting on all objects

- Performance: Dynamic objects that are outside view will not refresh (culled detection). Need to add an exception for special cases.

- Terrain edition, GUI for brush radius parameter added.

- Terrain tile size can be defined in a XML file (config.xml)

- Terrain height is now 1/4 of the terrain tile size 

- Terrain Shader updates on the mesh size

- Terrain mesh can be changed (higher or lower mesh density can be used now).

- Terrain tree size randomized when painting

- GUI: added icons for disabled states, as that was patched before 1.7.1

- GUI: New project and Help buttons are disabled during gameplay

- French language added 

- German language added (Bot1q) (IRB can operate now in English, Portugese, French and German)

- Shaders folder renamed to lowercase such as the other folders (linux filesystem is case sensitive)

January 2011
- Removed most of the functions in the player class, the player is now referencing a dynamic object

- the dynamic object class has been improved with the new functions the player class had, so most of the new feature introduced to the player should be available to all dynamic objects.

- The item inventory feature is now available to all dynamic objects.

- the XML loading of the dynamic object is now configurable as a "set" as it could get bigger as a single file. The main XML, can load separate XML configuration "sets" of dynamic objects. This is needed since the player and lot of other types of objects will be loaded as dynamic objects.
